# bahz

bahz (Bayesian Analysis of Hybrid Zones) is an R package for fitting and
analyzing one-dimensional, geographic cline models in hybrid zones.

bahz is currently under active development.

## Installation

Before installing bahz, you’ll need to install the R package RStan,
which interfaces with the Stan modelling language. To install RStan,
follow the instructions
[here](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started).

Once Rstan is installed, you can install bahz from Github. If you don’t
already have it, you’ll need to install the R package
[devtools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html):

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
```

Then, you can install bahz:

``` r
devtools::install_github("tjthurman/BAHZ") 
library(bahz)
```

bahz is not currently available from CRAN. If you have any issues
installing bahz, please [file an issue on
GitHub](https://github.com/tjthurman/BAHZ/issues).

## How to use bahz

Though bahz is still under development, the core model-fitting
functionality is operational. Here’s a mini-tutorial (with minimal
explanation) on how to fit a hybrid zone model with bahz. There is
further information in the help files for each function. A more complete
tutorial is in the works.

#### Prepare Data

To generate data to analyze, we can simulate genetic data from a
one-dimenional genetic cline. bahz provides a function for performing
this simulation, which automatically outputs the data in the format
needed for downstream analyses. See the the help file at
`?prep_geno_data` for information on supported formats.

Here, we will simulate a cline that was sampled across a 500 kilometer
transect, with sampling sites every 15 kilometers and 30 individuals
sampled at each site. For the cline, we will simulate a decreasing
cline, with a cline center at 237 km, a width of 62 km, and minimim and
maximum allele frequencies of 0.05 and 0.99, respectively:

``` r
set.seed(123)
data <- sim_geno_cline(transect_distances = seq(0,500,15), n_ind = 30, Fis = 0,
                       decrease = T, center = 237, width = 62, 
                       pmin = 0.05, pmax = .99)
head(data)
#>   site transectDist cline.p cline.f AA Aa aa  N emp.p emp.f
#> 1    1            0    0.99       0 30  0  0 30 1.000     0
#> 2    2           15    0.99       0 29  1  0 30 0.983     0
#> 3    3           30    0.99       0 28  2  0 30 0.967     0
#> 4    4           45    0.99       0 30  0  0 30 1.000     0
#> 5    5           60    0.99       0 30  0  0 30 1.000     0
#> 6    6           75    0.99       0 28  2  0 30 0.967     0
```

#### Specify priors

bahz fits Bayesian models, and thus users need to specify prior
distributions for the parameters to be estimated. This is done through a
prior configuration file. Users first generate a configuration file with
the command:

``` r
make_prior_config()
```

By default this will generate a configuration file template,
`prior_config_template.yaml`, in the current working directory. Users
can specify other file locations or names. Open the file and edit the
priors as you see fit. For this tutorial, you can leave the priors at
their default vaules.

#### Fit the model

With our data and priors ready, we can now fit a cline model. For now,
we will fit the simplest cline model, using the binomial model of allele
frequencies and no introgression tails:

``` r
set.seed(456)
cline.fit <- fit_geno_cline(data = data, prior_file = "prior_config_template.yaml",
                            type = "bi", tails = "none")
```

#### Analyze the results

We can summarize the posterior distribution of the cline parameters:

``` r
cline_summary(cline.fit)
#>    param   mean median se_mean   sd low_0.95_HPDI up_0.95_HPDI n_eff Rhat
#> 1 center 237.51 237.49    0.04 2.37        232.96       242.28  4115    1
#> 2  width  67.59  67.40    0.09 6.06         55.85        79.46  4964    1
#> 3   pmin   0.04   0.04    0.00 0.01          0.03         0.05  4255    1
#> 4   pmax   0.99   0.99    0.00 0.00          0.98         0.99  5226    1
#> 5    dev 116.07 115.45    0.07 2.87        112.18       121.68  1699    1
```

The model has done a good job. The point estimates of the parameters are
quite close to the values we specified, and the 95% credible intervals
contain the simulated values.

bahz provides a simple plotting function for visualizating fitted
clines:

``` r
plot_cline(stanfit = cline.fit, data = data,
           add.obs = T, confidence = T,
           xlab = "distance", ylab = "allele frequency")
```

For users who wish to make higher-quality, customized plots, bahz has a
helper function to calculate predicted allele frequencies and confidence
intervals from fitted clines. Those data can then be used in the
plotting system of the user’s choice, e.g.:

``` r
pred_cline <- predict_cline(stanfit = cline.fit, 
                            distance = 0:500, 
                            confidence = T)
head(pred_cline)
#>   transectDist         p low_0.95_HPDI up_0.95_HPDI
#> 1            0 0.9899993     0.9772721    0.9940613
#> 2            1 0.9899992     0.9772721    0.9940612
#> 3            2 0.9899992     0.9772721    0.9940612
#> 4            3 0.9899991     0.9772721    0.9940611
#> 5            4 0.9899991     0.9772721    0.9940611
#> 6            5 0.9899990     0.9772721    0.9940610
```

``` r
# Use the ggplot2 package
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = pred_cline, aes(x = transectDist, y = p,
                              ymin = low_0.95_HPDI,
                              ymax = up_0.95_HPDI)) +
  geom_ribbon(fill = alpha("orange", 0.3)) +
  geom_line(color = "orange") +
    xlab("distance along transect") +
  ylab("allele frequency") +
  theme_classic()
```
