#' Simulate genetic data from a cline
#'
#' This function generates a dataframe with simulated genotypic data sampled
#' from a genetic cline. The sampling sites, number of individuals, level of
#' inbreeding, and cline parameters are supplied by the user. Cline parameters
#' are flexible, and can model both sigmoid clines and stepped clines with
#' introgresison tails.
#'
#' This function calls \code{\link{general_cline_eqn}} for each sampled point along the
#' cline to generate the expected allele frequency at that point. The calculated
#' allele frequency and provided Fis are then used to calculate the expected
#' genotype frequencies for each site, according to the equations:
#'
#' \deqn{AA = p^2 + p(1-p)Fis}
#' \deqn{Aa = 2p(1-p)(1-Fis)}
#' \deqn{aa = (1-p)^2 + p(1-p)Fis}
#'
#' Sampled genotypes are then drawn from a multinomial distribution, with the
#' expected genotype frequencies as the probabilities. From those sampled
#' genotypes, empirical allele frequencies (emp.p) and empirical Fis estimates
#' (emp.f) are calculated as:
#'
#' \deqn{emp.p = (2*AA + Aa)/N}
#' \deqn{emp.f = (Hexp - Hobs)/Hexp}
#'
#' where AA is the number of honozygotes of the focal allele, Aa is the number
#' of heterozygotes, N is the number of sampled individuals, and  Hexp and Hobs
#' are the expected and observed heterozygosity. Fis values are corrected with
#' \link{correct_fis}, such that empirical Fis values which are undefined or < 0
#' are corrected to 0.

#'   tails). Numeric. tauL must be between 0 and 1 (inclusive).
#' @param deltaR,tauR Optional delta and tau parameters which describe the right
#'   exponential tail. Must supply both to generate a tail. Default is \code{NA} (no
